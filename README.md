🤖 aifirst

aifirst is my first AI-based project, created to explore and understand the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, machine learning workflows, and practical implementation using code. This project serves as a starting point for building, experimenting, and learning AI concepts hands-on.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of aifirst is to:

Learn how AI models are structured and executed

Work with data preprocessing and basic model logic

Understand end-to-end AI project flow

Build a foundation for more advanced AI/ML projects in the future
